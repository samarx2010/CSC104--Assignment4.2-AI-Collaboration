This is a website that shows examples of my video game artwork that is based off of video games. 
I wanted the site to showcase my work with polaroid formatted images to give the page a little bit of flare. 
I used GitHub Co-Pilot to generate the things I wanted to have on the site. I have also added links to my main portfolio site 
to utilize the link functions in HTML.

Requirements for Asssignment is here:
Pick a theme for your website.
Now have the AI write a website to support your theme.
Have your friends and family test your website as you develop it to give you suggestions this week.
Your code should be commented - the AI can do this for you with the right prompts.
For full points, your website must be completed and a YouTube video link submitted; otherwise, zero points could be given for this assignment.
The demo video should be 1 to 3 minutes long, with an introduction of yourself and your website and a thorough discussion of the AI prompts you used to create the website.
View the page using the GitHub HTML previewer after uploading to GitHub: https://htmlpreview.github.io/Links to an external site.
Note: the code you generate in this assignment CANNOT be used in your final project.
